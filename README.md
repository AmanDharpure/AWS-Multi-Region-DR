Production-ready Disaster Recovery Architecture built on AWS using Terraform.

Designed to automatically recover workloads from a Regional Failure while maintaining High Availability, Scalability and Infrastructure as Code.

# 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how enterprise applications can survive a complete AWS Regional outage using Infrastructure as Code and AWS-native Disaster Recovery services.

The architecture deploys identical infrastructure in two AWS Regions.

- **Primary Region:** us-east-1
- **Disaster Recovery Region:** us-west-2

If the primary region becomes unavailable, traffic automatically fails over to the DR region using Amazon Route53.
